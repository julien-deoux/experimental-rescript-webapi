Provides a storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs that are cached, for example as part of the ServiceWorker life cycle.

The WorkerGlobalScope interface of the Web Workers API is an interface representing the scope of any worker.
Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by Window objects â€”
in this case event handlers, the console or the associated WorkerNavigator object. 
Each WorkerGlobalScope has its own event loop.
