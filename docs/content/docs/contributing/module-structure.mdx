import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The bindings are organized by the Web API they represent. Each API has its interfaces and auxiliary types in a module named after the API, suffixed with `API` to prevent collisions with the type module.

<FileTree>

- package.json
- src
  - DOMAPI.res
  - DOMAPI/
    - HTMLElement.res

</FileTree>

Within the API module, the structure is roughly as follows:

- Enum Types
- Interfaces
- Auxiliary Types

## Enum types

Enum types are used to represent constants in the Web API. They are typically used as arguments to methods or properties.
In ReScript terms these are variants:

```ReScript
type scrollBehavior =
  | @as("auto") Auto
  | @as("instant") Instant
  | @as("smooth") Smooth
```

Enums come first as they are always self-contained and do not depend on other types.

## Interfaces

[Interfaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API#interfaces) are modeled as record types and are the core of the bindings.
They represent the properties and methods of the Web API. If an interface inherits from another interface, the base interface is spread into the inheriting interface.

```ReScript
type htmlSpanElement = {
  ...htmlElement,
}
```

<Aside>
  Properties spreading is not possible in recursive types! When a circular
  reference is detected, the base properties are duplicated instead.
</Aside>

```ReScript
type rec node = {
  nodeName: string
  // ... more properties
}

and element = {
  // duplicated property from node
  nodeName: string
  // ... more properties
}
```

## Auxiliary Types

Auxiliary types are used to represent types that are not directly related to the Web API but are used in the bindings.
These can occur both before interfaces and after interfaces, depending on the context.

```ReScript
type eventListenerOptions = {mutable capture?: bool}

// Model after the documentation of
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#options
type addEventListenerOptions = {
  ...eventListenerOptions,
  mutable passive?: bool,
  mutable once?: bool,
  mutable signal?: abortSignal,
}
```
