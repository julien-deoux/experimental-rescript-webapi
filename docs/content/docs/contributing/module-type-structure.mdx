import { Aside, FileTree, Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Every interface in a Web API module can potentially contain methods. These methods are modeled in a separate module named after the interface.

The primary reason for this separation is to handle method overloads.
As explained in the [Design Philosophy](../design-philosophy) section, ReScript does not permit records to define the same properties more than once.
Therefore, methods with overloads cannot be modeled within the same record type.

## Bindings

Another advantage of having a separate file is that these bindings can utilize all types defined in the API module.
Under normal circumstances, the type module only contains `@send` bindings where the type is the first parameter.

<FileTree>

- DOMAPI
  - HTMLButtonElement.res

</FileTree>

```ReScript
/**
Returns whether a form will validate when it is submitted, without having to submit it.
[Read more on MDN](
  https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement/checkValidity)
*/
@send
external checkValidity: htmlButtonElement => bool = "checkValidity"
```

## Inheritance

When an interface inherits from another interface, the base interface methods can be [included](https://rescript-lang.org/syntax-lookup#include) into the inheriting interface.  
All methods from [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement#instance_methods) should also be available on [HTMLButtonElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement#instance_methods).

export const htmlElementModule = `
open DOMAPI

// A concrete type for \`T.t\` is passed later using the \`include\` keyword.
module Impl = (T: { type t }) => {

/**
[Read more on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus)
*/
@send
external focus: (T.t, ~options: focusOptions=?) => unit = "focus"

}

include Impl({ type t = htmlElement })
`;

<Code
  code={htmlElementModule}
  title="DOMAPI/HTMLElement.res"
  lang="ReScript"
></Code>

export const buttonModule = `
open DOMAPI

// Include all the methods from HTMLElement
include HTMLElement.Impl({ type t = htmlButtonElement })

// Add additional methods specific to HTMLButtonElement:

/**
Returns whether a form will validate when it is submitted, without having to submit it.
[Read more on MDN](
  https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement/checkValidity)
*/
@send
external checkValidity: htmlButtonElement => bool = "checkValidity"
`;

<Code
  code={buttonModule}
  title="DOMAPI/HTMLButtonElement.res"
  lang="ReScript"
></Code>
