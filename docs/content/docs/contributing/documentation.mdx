After the bindings are generated, all you got was a link to the MDN documentation.  
While again, not that bad, it can be improved by adding the core of the binding to the documentation.
And explain how it is supposed to be used.

## Importance

One could wonder how important documentation is in this case?  
A link to MDN is enough, right? Well, not always.
When a method has multiple overloads, it can be hard to understand which one to use.  
By adding an example usage, the user can see easily see which one to use.
It keeps the user inside the IDE and avoids context switching.

## Structure

The documentation for each binding should roughly follow this structure:

- signature
- key description (tip: check MDN for inspiration)
- example usage
- link to the MDN documentation

For example, the `window.fetch` function could be documented as:

````ReScript
/*
`fetch(string, init)`

Starts the process of fetching a resource from the network,
returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.

```res
window->Window.fetch("https://rescript-lang.org")
```

@send
external fetch: (window, string, ~init: requestInit=?)
  => Promise.t<response> = "fetch"
````
